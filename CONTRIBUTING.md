# Coding style

 - Use tabs
 - Wrap lines at 120 characters
 - Make all local variables, method and function arguments, and utility classes
		 final (as much as I hate Java's verbosity, I'm in the habit of doing
		 things this way and don't feel like changing it)
 - Follow coding convention used elsewhere in the project (more or less BSD KNF
		 style); eg. opening brace on the same line, spaces around operators, etc.
 - Don't worry about it too muchâ€¦ it's just a plugin.
